The documentation is organised into the following categories (**start browsing by selecting one from the menu at the top right**):

- **User**:   The user guides cover the background and purpose of DHIS 2 together with instructions and explanations of how to perform tasks such as data entry, meta-data set-up, import and export of data, aggregation, reporting and other topics related to the usage of the software.  
The End user manual is a light-weight version of the User manual meant for end users such as district records officers and data entry clerks.

- **Implementer**: The implementer guides are targeted at implementers and super-users and address subjects such as system design, database development, data harmonization, analysis, deployment, human resources needed and integration with other systems. Configuration of the Android app is also covered.

- **Developer**: The developer manuals provide a detailed description of the DHIS2 core API and functionality, as well as the Android DHIS2 Software Development Kit (SDK). They serve as essential resources for developers building upon the DHIS2 platform.

- **Sysadmin**: The system administration guide aims to provide support for the installation and maintenance of the DHIS2 platform.

The DHIS2 documentation is a collective effort and has been developed by the development team and users. While the guides strive to be complete, there may be certain functionalities which have been omitted or which have yet to be documented.
